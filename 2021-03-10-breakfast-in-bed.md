I had breakfast in bed for ten days, here’s what happened.
Or: If you don’t want to change, you’ll change anyway.

IT HAPPENED. I had time to prepare, and then again I wasn’t prepared at all. You’re gone, for now, I left you at a train station, tears and sobs and all, and FFP2 masks out of place (yes, it’s still that time), the security staff gently ignoring us. And now the apartment is empty. Still stuffed with furniture (and clothes and knick-knacks), but without your presence (and clothes and knick knacks). I went through this moment in my head so many times and couldn’t really think past it. But yes… strangely enough, there’s a “past it”. I’m still here; I didn’t dissolve into nothingness.

Now I imagine that the sheets still smell like you, while I should finally have a shower. You left your furry hat which you certainly won’t need in Australia, and the red towel that will likely be hanging from the bathroom door forever. And for three days now, I avoided the kitchen, and instead of having breakfast at the table just like any other civilized human being, a three-minute egg and pancakes and half a grapefruit and whatnot, I grab the first thing I can find in the fridge, and stumble back to my musty, warm bed, trying to hold on to “before”.

*“Not over, just different”*, you promised when you booked your flight.

I never liked breakfast in bed, by the way. It’s like sex on the beach, a nice idea, but that’s more or less it. You end up with crumbs in the most inappropriate parts of your body, and you spill over coffee and just when you feel comfortable enough you realize that you forgot something in the other room, salt for the three-minute egg or a spoon for the grapefruit. 

This would be the moment to confess: The headline of this post is a lie. 

I probably won’t last ten days, so I might never be able to tell you what happens after that (you lose all energy, and your body gets stiff and wrinkly as you soak in orange juice, with a newspaper sticking to your butt). We always died laughing about these “I did x for x days, here’s what happened.” Does anyone ever honestly say what doesn’t happen? I meditated for ten days – and then: nothing? No change? 

I loved our morning conversations, and the fact that, in between sentences, you would occasionally jump up to get your notebook (and that we then, always, thought: Damn, we should have recorded this!). I never had a blog, and I was never a fan of putting my life on display. I’m a fiction writer, and turning very mundane personal experiences into very exciting fictional events always felt like the maximum publicity I could bear. 

Doing it anyway now. Ha. New times, new measures, just like the two of us moved from one space to another. Not just in a physical way (well, you did, whereas I’m only moving from the bed to the toilet right now). Moved from one stage to another, having crossed some invisible line. Not always is the moment so clear, a good-bye on a platform, and a train heading off in a different direction (and the thought, crystal-clear: “Stop that fucking train! Now!”). Often, change comes slowly. Sometimes you don’t notice the threshold, only in retrospect. But cross it we must, for better or worse, as much as we humans seem to be wired on permanence, houses and prenups and the sneakers everyone wears and our social media perpetuum mobile. Even the new sensation is reliable. 

It is frightening, real change, the one that you can’t predict and can’t control, the fact that things have to transform in order to evolve and grow, that, like the change of seasons, things are born and die and are re-born again, spring to summer to autumn to winter and to spring, that endless yo-yo effect of nature. We sure want the peaks not the valleys, but the only thing one can do is to flow with the tides – and hope for the best. You like to call it surrender. I dislike the word. I feel like it has a meaning of defeat to it, like fate has to break you entirely before you can piece your life back together. But maybe that’s for you to write about, redeem the reputation of the word surrender (that’s in your notebook, haha, see how I laid the ground for you here?).

Nothing about that transformation went effortlessly though. We wanted to do it with grace, but it’s struggling and holding on and crying and being scared shitless. Instead of flowing with the tides I feel like a huge wave has pulled me under, thrown me against something hard and tore away my bikini top. I didn’t ask for the change. I tried to resist it. I don’t even want to change the sheets! Surrender’s a pain in the ass, if you ask me. And yes, why can’t I just hold on to the good stuff? Why can’t I have it all? And why did I just let you go?

Damn, I really miss you!

I tried to surrender for ten days, and here’s what happened: Nothing. Or everything. It’s hard to say, I’m only three days in, that’s when the hard part begins, the itching when you really want to scratch yourself but can’t… Yet, I throw myself in, into these beautiful terrifying wild waves, rising and falling and rising again, just as you do. And hope for the best. 

"Hope" was, by the way, the first track of my random weekly (ever-changing) playlist.
