<!-- ## We had these wonderful breakfast table conversations... -->

#### Or Rather

We had these wonderful breakfast table conversations. About life and the appropriate sailing metaphors, about the best Blade Runner version and which beans are better in a cassoulet, small or large ones. About Wittgenstein and Ronaldo. About fake Zen monks and real Youtube gurus, about the fact that we’re not cool (without ever wondering: Why?) and whether we need to have those crippling moments of self-doubt in order to generate something authentic and worthwhile. Our conversations would almost always take so long until one of us had to jump up and really get some “proper” work done.  

And when C. went to Australia for a while, we decided that we wanted to continue these talks. A conversation, set between Australia and Germany, nine and a half hours apart (and this weird sensation of crossing ten timezones in order to get to another, the sun rising more than once in a day, the non-spaces with the non-windows and the quarantine inside quarantine, only to then arrive in a half-timezone, in the surrealism of Being John Malkovich on the half-floor between 7 and 8.)

It’s one of us posting at the time, whatever thought crosses our mind as a reply or comment on the prior post. Sometimes big, sometimes mundane. Sometimes political, sometimes personal. Random rants and ethical essays. Funny (hopefully) or philosophical (or philosophy dumbed down). Sometimes poems, sometimes film reviews (or sailing metaphors). Call and response, as close as it gets to our beloved talks with too much coffee and even more condensed milk in it. 

Only that one’s breakfast is now the other one’s dinner...
