#### A note about who we are...

Hi, we are C. and D.! We’ve always had these wonderful, endless breakfast table conversations. But when C. went to Australia for a while, we decided that we wanted to continue these talks. One of us posting at a time, call and response. A conversation that continues to sail the oceans between the mundane, beautiful, poignant, political, personal and amusing. Set between Australia and Germany… nine and a half hours apart.
