I wanted my first contribution to be seamless and focused, to tap into all the thoughts and emotions that your first post captures. But, the next thing I knew I was in an aluminum can following the curve of the earth and overcome by the fact that we have never gone for aas long as 12.5 hours without talking. Then, of course, all the wheels fell off!

Not here anymore but not yet there/ not here not there / did I miss the threshold or am I stuck in it?

In this state I decided that maybe I should just continue to text you even though you will get a jolt when 12 hours worth of reflections hit you all at once! And so I did‚Ä¶

[text 1] C: I have been immediately struck by one thing. As soon as we took off and the crew started warming up the meals, I was transported to somewhere that I didn't know I had been missing: the lands of exquisite south east Asian food. No more crazed shouting about bad German food (which I also secretly love) where it is just not possible to find these truly beautiful and mesmerising flavours, these daily works of art, and all the richness which belongs to the cuisines of SE Asia (and Australia).

[text 2] C: Actually, I am now incredibly excited at the prospect of eating at the Flower Drum in Melbourne‚Äôs Chinatown or going to the noodle places that my brother finds on the mundane suburban streets of his neighbourhood.

[text 3] C: I've just realized that the policy on these multi-timezone flights is to go straight into the time at destination. So, dinner has been immediately served and now we're in complete darkness, and me just a few hours ago having gotten out of bed after sleeping for the best part of 12 hours!

[text 4] C: It is somehow significant to be reading Wittgenstein (well, by proxy, it's a biography... but it quotes many original passages and letters from LW). My journey feels like it is following his. You pointed out that I have "thrived" in recent months, and it gives me great courage to feel that, like Wittgenstein, we can always change and it is, perhaps, a duty to ourselves and to life to strive to do so, to thrive and live. And in this duty to be guided by two questions, perhaps the only possible questions: ‚Äúwhat should I do?‚Äù and ‚Äúhow should I live?‚Äù

[text 5] C: It is somewhat ironic that in the passages I read about Wittgenstein's life that (while I was being "interrogated" by immigration at Schiphol‚Ä¶ plunging me back into my existential storm) LW was fleeing for his life (literally) in the Carpathian mountains as the Russian's advanced.

[text 6] C: There is something so beautiful in LW's connection of logic and ethics, and it is this that has driven my fascination with Wittgenstein, my sense of fraternity.

[text 7] C: In fact, I wonder if we are still as "human" as the men and women of the late 19th and early 20th centuries? While this generation participated in organizing and conducting the most catastrophic events in human history, at the same time in their correspondence many (although certainly not all) remained so human, so authentic. I wonder if we are even capable of this today, or has our relation to other people become like the communication technologies we use: short, self-serving, unreflective?

[text 8] C: This whole impulse of mine was triggered by reading the famous opening words from the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: "What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent." I can't think, at least at the moment, of another such proposition which is at the same time both so logically and philosophically clear and so beautiful! Although Wittgenstein moved far away from the aims of the TLP, he never abandoned the spirit of this statement. His work attempted to show that logical, ethical and aesthetic propositions are "truths" and have the same structure. This structure can never be spoken of (described in language) but only shown and while at the time this statement was regarded as the introduction of bolshevism into mathematics and philosophy does it not feel true to us?
 
For me you might consider to ‚Äúdumb it down‚Äù just a bit, maybe in one sentence. You don‚Äôt have to, but I personally don‚Äôt know enough about Wittgenstein to fully understand the logical, ethical and aesthetic propositions, and why they trigger you now, in this moment of transition.

[text 9] C: Not only is the intersection of the logical (the rational), ethical and aesthetic -- beauty, art, poetry... all that is attempted in the rendering of human experience into some form of representation -- where my greatest interest lies it also feels like an inescapable duty to pursue this intersection. Exactly the insane and mystical impulse that gripped Wittgenstein.

This is also the intersection of so many people and teachings we‚Äôve spent weeks discussing: John O'Donohue and the realisation of life as beauty; the question of ethics in business and the capitalist social structure; and the logical versus the mystical (that we cannot but seek to understand the world in which we are).

[text 10] C: It‚Äôs strange but somehow also thrilling to be almost alone on the aircraft. I had hardly given it a thought but when you mentioned the plane would likely be "packed" I became quite apprehensive. Not just to be jammed up against the next person and gasping for uncontaminated air, but for the lack of space to let go of the terrible stress that I‚Äôve been living with for so long.

But the empty plane has allowed me, finally, to breathe after holding my breath and one final moment of anxiety at the border in Amsterdam. 

I can finally start to feel what it is like "to put to sea with the sails billowing in friendly winds." It's not that I don't miss so many people terribly already (inc. you, my sons) but that, for now, I have some space in which I can move a bit closer to myself.

[text 11] C: Flying directly over the cradle of wine, now... and Tblisi. Would love to spend time there again. Maybe it's possible to sail to the Black Sea? I have just noticed that Georgia has proper mountains! I can see them sticking up almost to the level that we're flying on. Incredible and beautiful.

[text 12] C: Maybe a cabin in the hills for a while... writing and cooking! We could visit some of my favourite places: the Vino Underground (a natural wine mecca) and the beautiful Georgian restaurant that is hidden in a courtyard behind the National Parliamentary Library on Lado Gudiashvili Street.

[text 13] C: I am gazing out the window, now, at the perfectly true shapes of the world. The world ‚Äútrue‚Äù imposes itself: the curve of the wing; the roundness of the frozen lakes beneath us; the horizon as it splits the sun's rays into pink and orange and red and purple. I think these are the same truths expressed in the cut of a sail or the shape of a hull; the same as the correspondence between the wing tip of a bird and edge of a wave.

[text 14] C: And now it is dark... like the ocean.

[text 15] C: Just when I think I can relax I‚Äôm struck by an awful anxiety that I might loose (lose?) these eyes and this heart that wants to feel and express these things. The very eyes and heart that began to come to life over your breakfast table.

[text 16] C: (thought: I wonder if posting these as I write them, without an internet connection, will preserve their times or will you receive them as one long stretch of babble?)

[text 17] C: Trying to stay positive... but occasional twinges of "what have I done?" Perhaps these are good things, nothing is fixed, and I feel far better to be in motion and open to the world rather than thinking I am a victim and the universe is against me or nothing can be trusted. It is precisely this openness and trust that is the key!

[text 18] C: Or maybe it's the wine talking now! I have my own private bottle of white wine (apparently no one else wants any ü§î) and now I've interrupted my fast to have a few glasses. It's nothing like as inspiring as a glass of "naturwein" but it will have to do.

[text 19] C: (thought: haha... you thought that we would be out of communication for the longest time since we met... but, little do you realize, the communication is taking place nonetheless!  üòÜ)

[text 20] C: So, it also turns out that Wittgenstein enjoyed one of our favourite sports: making fun of popular culture (LW: advertising; US YouTube). Later in his life, Wittgenstein would tear out newspaper advertisements and send them to his friend, ridiculing their absurd style: "one instinctively feels that 'Two Steeples No. 83 Quality Sock' is a real man's sock. It's a sock of taste -- dressy, fashionable, comfortable." If YouTube had existed I‚Äôm sure he would have made a video entitled: "I wore a Two Steeples No. 83 Sock every day for 30 days. Here's what happened."

[text 21] C: We land in an hour. I've plowed through almost 600 pages of the Wittgenstein biography which seems like as good a way as I could spend 12 hours circling the planet. I've had breakfast (a beautiful souffle) to offset the slight uneasiness of fasting for days followed by glasses of wine! But all is well. I am now eagerly waiting for the sun to rise for the second time in (my) day!

[text 22] C: Haha... they just told us that is it 04:50 in Singapore and 26¬∞C

This could also be the last paragraph of the post. It‚Äôs kind of a ‚Äúclear‚Äù ending. You‚Äôre landing but still you‚Äôre in the void. Maybe because this is like life: It‚Äôs a never-ending transition. 

But then again, I also love the ‚Äúwave‚Äù theme in the end of text 25 as an ending for a post. Actually, both are great.  

[text 23] C: I'm not entirely sure about Wittgenstein, at the moment. I feel like he has (re)emerged now for a reason. It is something to do with ethics: his, mine, in general. But I also don't want to start a process of months long "research" drift and I need to stay focused and figure out what this means for the "ethics of business" thing. 

Either way, I'm absolutely loving the biography. So well written by a very knowledgeable and sympathetic author. A longer term interaction with texts from Wittgenstein and others can only come from writing, not from endless contemplation, although this was, in some ways, exactly the method LW used to produce his two major ‚Äúbooks‚Äù.

I somehow don‚Äôt need this paragraph (Text 23), it‚Äôs a bit confusing to - at this point - go back to Wittgenstein. But that‚Äôs just my taste, you can definitely keep it. 

[text 24] C: Argh! Just bashed my watch against the seat. It's just another part of the transition... thata threshold I have to cross. The watch is like me, it's made to be in the world and exposed to life (although I still long for the perfection of the idea rather than actual reality... for the watch and for me üòÜ Such a coward.)

[text 25] C: I keep having these sensations. The old ones. Rising up, making me hold my breath, focus my mind around a single point of anxiety demanding control instead of openness (surrender), acceptance, trust. 

It's like those waves. I don't know if it is the tide or just some cyclical aspect of waves... but every so often, every few minutes, every 6th wave, or some other cycle... a bigger wave rises up. You know the feeling when you're wading out from the beach and standing chest deep in the water and then this bigger wave or set of waves roll in and panic sets in. The water starts to rise. It's cold and you know you have to rise up with it or plunge your head under the cold surface. You are briefly paralyzed not knowing whether to start swimming, to jump at just the last moment, or whether to let the wave itself carry you up and then down again. 

This description already holds a key to understanding what to do. Why, then, this moment of panic that returns each time we enter the water or on each of life‚Äôs daily cycle of swells...?
