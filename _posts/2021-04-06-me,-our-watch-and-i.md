##Me, our watch and I

I was late, oh yes. Two wasted hours, some frayed nerves and a missed barbecue. But it was neither my fault nor the watch’s, Scout’s honor, but entirely the BVG, Berlin’s public transport corporation, messing it all up. 
Still, and that’s the actual point, my watch isn’t entirely reliable these days. To be honest, I think I have a lovesick watch! 

It was yours before, a beautiful, elegant mechanical wristwatch, and it clearly hasn’t gotten over the fact that you left. It gained about 20 minutes when you flew forwards in time, like it couldn’t let go and desperately wanted to catch up on those nine and a half hours, then it protested against being wound up (it needed a proper shake and some more compassionate words), then it stopped altogether, complete meltdown. And now it’s up and running again… as of now.

Not really the most convincing features for a watch, but what can I say? I totally sympathize with it. It looks solid and unbreakable, waterproof, bulletproof, everything-proof, ready to stand the test of time. But it is sensitive and has, as you pointed out, a personality of its own. It’s British, any more questions?
And… we’re in this together, me and my watch! I, too, try to come to terms with saying “good morning” at 11pm and “good night” in the early afternoon, and that provisory feeling to it, like I need some winding up every morning to keep going as well. But I, too, do keep going, in spite of gaining time and losing time, occasional meltdowns and the need for a proper shake and some loving words. 

Should I mention that I also developed a tender relationship with my phone, constantly violating the “no phones in bed” rule, since somehow, it’s the personification of “you”, pixelated images and words in green and white bubbles? Or does that make me seem even more weird? Like a cat lady who has no cats but lovesick watches and needy little plastic boxes (and a laptop that is occasionally on strike!), and who is – certainly – about to be transformed any time soon into an electronic device herself like Gregor Samsa? 

Okay, I’ll stop now. 

Could you, dear, wind me up, please
