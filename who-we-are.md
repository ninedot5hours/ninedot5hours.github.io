## Hi, we are C. and D.!

We’ve always had these wonderful, endless breakfast table conversations. But when C. went to Australia for a while, we decided that we wanted to continue these talks. One of us posting at a time, call and response. A conversation that continues to sail the oceans between the mundane, beautiful, poignant, political, personal and amusing. Set between Australia and Germany… nine and a half hours apart.

D. is… a scriptwriter, nervous about cooking but brave about eating, walks on ice, lies on the floor (unwillingly), and finds deep wonder in quotidian stuff.

C. is a writer who loves horses, sailing, confit canard, natural wine & hand grinding my coffee. Each day I engage with life, beauty, truth… Wittgenstein & Marx
